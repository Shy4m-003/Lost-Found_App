# Lost-Found_App
Lost &amp; Found Portal is a microservices-based application that helps students track and manage lost items like ID cards, keys, and books. The system is built using modular services such as User, Item, Notification, Search, QR/Verification, and Reporting/Analytics, all communicating via REST APIs or event-driven patterns.
